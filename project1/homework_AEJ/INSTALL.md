# Installation and Compilation Instructions

This project computes the Hartree-Fock energy and MP2 correlation energy using the TREXIO library.

## 1. Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you must install the HDF5 library and the TREXIO library.

### 1.1. HDF5 Library
TREXIO depends on HDF5. Install it via your package manager:

* **Ubuntu/Debian:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libhdf5-dev
* **MACOS:**
brew install hdf5

### 1.2. TREXIO Library (v2.5.0)

You need to manually install TREXIO. Follow these steps:
1. Download the source code: https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio/releases/download/v2.5.0/trexio-2.5.0.tar.gz
2. Unzip and install :
```bash
tar -zxvf trexio-2.5.0.tar.gz
cd trexio-2.5.0
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
(This usually installs the library to /usr/local/lib and headers to /usr/local/include.)

## 2. Compilation

Run the following command on the working directory:
```bash
gcc -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib src/*.c -o mp2 -ltrexio -lm
```
## 2.1 Flags explanation:

-I/usr/local/include: Look for header files (trexio.h) here.

-L/usr/local/lib: Look for library files here.

src/*.c: Compiles all C source files found in the src folder.

-ltrexio: Links the TREXIO library.

-lm: Links the standard math library.

-o mp2: Creates the executable file named mp2.
## 3. Use of program
To ensure the installation works correctly, run the generated mp2 binary file in the shell  on the provided C2H2 dataset:
```bash
./mp2 data/c2h2.h5
```
### 3.1 Correction of errors
```bash
If you receive an error saying libtrexio.so cannot be found, add the library path to your environment variables before running:```
* **On Linux:**
    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
    ```
* **On macOS:**
    ```bash
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
    ```
Then run the executable again.
./mp2 data/c2h2.h5
```
